## Problem Statement:

You have a messy list (input1.txt), a shopping cart full of DMC threads you've added for a new cross stitch project. You have another messy list (input2.txt) of the unformatted, copy/pasted list from your pattern. You want to verify if all the codes from your project have been added into your shopping cart without going through 1 by 1.

## How to use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xMiyu/cross_stitch_verify.git
```
Create your input1.txt and input2.txt within the same folder as the ipynb file, then open it and follow the instructions!

## Example input1.txt:
DMC 160 Six Strand Floss 1 x $0.66
DMC 165 Six Strand Floss 1 x $0.66
DMC 166 Six Strand Floss 1 x $0.66
